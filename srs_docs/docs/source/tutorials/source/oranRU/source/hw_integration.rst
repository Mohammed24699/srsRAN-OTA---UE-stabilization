These documents aim to show the specific steps needed to configure RUs and Switches for use with the srsRAN CU/DU in 
an O-RAN Split 7.2 compliant network. For information on the overall network configuration and architecture, see 
the :ref:`O-RAN 7.2 Guide <oran_ru_tutorial>`. 

The following guides contain sample configuration and the necessary supplementary files where relevant. These documents 
are intended to be used as guides, users should always refer back to the manufacturer's documentation for specific 
information regarding stable firmware versions, drivers, configuration files and other hardware specific information. 
Questions relating to hardware specific issues should be directed to the manufacturer of that hardware.
